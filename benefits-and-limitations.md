# VPN Benefits and Limitations

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Privacy**  
  VPNs mask your IP address, making your online activities harder to track by ISPs, advertisers, or hackers. This is especially useful on public Wi-Fi, where data interception risks are high.

- **Data Security**  
  Industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256) protects sensitive data like passwords and credit card details from being intercepted, ensuring secure browsing.

- **Access to Geo-Restricted Content**  
  VPNs allow you to bypass regional restrictions on streaming services (e.g., Netflix) by connecting to servers in different countries, although free VPNs like Proton VPN may have limited streaming capabilities.

- **Bypassing Censorship**  
  VPNs enable access to blocked websites in countries with internet restrictions, promoting freedom of information.

- **Prevention of ISP Throttling**  
  By encrypting your traffic, VPNs prevent ISPs from monitoring and throttling bandwidth-heavy activities like gaming or streaming.

## Limitations

- **Slower Speeds**  
  Encryption and routing through remote servers can reduce internet speeds. Free VPNs like Proton VPN may experience up to 16% speed loss, and premium VPNs typically lose 25% or less.

- **Limited Server Access**  
  Free VPNs offer fewer server locations (e.g., Proton VPN’s free plan has servers in only three countries), limiting geo-spoofing options and potentially causing server overcrowding.

- **Streaming and Torrenting Restrictions**  
  Free VPNs often don’t support streaming services like Netflix or P2P torrenting due to limited server capabilities.

- **Potential Privacy Risks**  
  Some free VPNs may log and sell user data, though reputable ones like Proton VPN have strict no-logs policies verified by audits. Always research the provider’s privacy policy.

- **Not Complete Anonymity**  
  VPNs hide your IP and encrypt traffic but don’t protect against browser fingerprinting, weak passwords, or data you voluntarily share online.

- **Legal and Regional Restrictions**  
  VPN usage is restricted or banned in some countries (e.g., China, Russia), and some services may block VPN traffic to enforce geo-restrictions.
